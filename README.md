# Auto Fish Feeder

If you keep a fish, you must think about the issue of the feeding when leaving the house. So, you may not have been on vacation. I had these problems and didn't want to give a lot of money to the machines. I developed this project by researching on the internet.

The box you see in the pictures full of fish feed, 12 hours intervals by turning the throws feed into the aquarium. There is no battery problem because it is plugged directly into the wall socket.

## Requirements

 - Arduino Uno
 - Servo Motor 
 - Charger Adapter
 - Usb Cable for Adapter
 - Any box for fish feed
 - Case for equipment
